{"name":"Blinkenpad","tagline":"mini remake of blinkenlights, which will be perhaps at congress","body":"Are you sad Blinkenlights is over?\r\n\r\n##Well, I got something for ya!\r\n\r\nI will use a Novation Launchpad - a MIDI controller, but there are LEDs under the buttons, which create a nice matrix(8x8). And YOU can participate!\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is to write animations(unfortunately no VE yet) in a python array. It looks like this:\r\n\r\n    [\r\n     [\r\n      [red leds], [yellow leds], [green leds]\r\n     ]\r\n     [\r\n      [red leds], [yellow leds], [green leds]\r\n     ]\r\n     [\r\n      [red leds], [yellow leds], [green leds]\r\n     ]\r\n     [\r\n      [red leds], [yellow leds], [green leds]\r\n     ]\r\n     [\r\n      [red leds], [yellow leds], [green leds]\r\n     ]\r\n    ]\r\n    \r\nOr, to explain it better:\r\n\r\n    [(animation start)\r\n     [(frame start)\r\n      [(all red leds in this frame)], \r\n      [(all yellow leds in this frame)], \r\n      [(all green leds in this frame)]\r\n     (frame end)]\r\n    (animation end)]\r\n(don't mind the round brackets)\r\n\r\nNext, send it to my address(will be here shortly). And who knows, perhaps you join the playlist!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
